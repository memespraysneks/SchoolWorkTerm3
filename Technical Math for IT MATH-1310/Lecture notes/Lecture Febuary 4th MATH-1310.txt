if you have the same variable in two statments you can take out the repeated statment

example: (z+x) * (z+y) = z + (x*y)

example 2: z U (x n y) = (z U x) n (z U y)e

SOP sum of all products:

collect data given and take all of the 1's and add them 

example

x y F
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 1
1 1 0

would be: 

F = x'y'+xy'
