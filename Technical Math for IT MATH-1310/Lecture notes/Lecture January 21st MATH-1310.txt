Converting to/from 2C:

Decimal to 2C:
if positive: 
-convert to unsigned binary pad with 0's if needed

if negative: 
-first take the absolute value to usigned binary pad with 0's if needed
-flip the bits (all 0's to 1's all 1's to 0's)
-add 1

2C to Decimal:
if positive:
-convert to decimal

if negative:
-flip the bits
-add 1
-convert to decimal
-add a negative (times by -1)

2^n-1 representation (biased representation)

-complementing the left most bit of a two's complement bit
-in biased representation some fixed integer b is added to every signed decimal integer before it is coded in binary
-bias = 2^n-1

To convert decimal to bias B 
1: added the bias
2: convert to unsigned binary
3: pad with 0's if needed

IEEE single precision standard:

the first bit holds the sign
next 8 bits hold the exponent
the last 23 bits hold the mantisa
(held in bias 127)

IEEE double precision standard

the first bit holds the sign
next 11 for the exponent
remaining 52 for the mantisa
(held in bias 1023)

if the exponents are all 0's and the mantisa is all 0's 
that is 0

if the exponents is all 1's and the mantisa is all 0's 
that is infinity

if the exponents are all 1's and the mantisa is not all 0's 
that is NaN (Not a Number)

if the exponents are all 0's and the mantisa is not all 0's
that is 0.(number) rather than normally it would be 1.(number)

MATH 1310 FLOATING POINT FORMAT

1 bit for the sign
4 bits for the exponent in bias/excess 7
5 bits for the mantissa

if the exponent = 0000 and the mantissa does not equal 00000 then the exponent is assumed to be -6
